![](https://images.serverlessfans.com/s-tool/zh/s-config-add-direct.jpg)

The following table lists the different settings for different cloud vendors:

```
alibaba: AccountID, AccessKeyID, AccessKeySecret
 aws: AccessKeyID, SecretAccessKey
 baidu: AccessKeyID, SecretAccessKey
 huawei: AccessKey, SecretKey
 tencent: AccountID, SecretID, SecretKey
```

### Other key configuration methods

You can create a project in `access.yaml `file to configure key information, for example:

```
# access.yaml

Key Information name 1:
    Key1: Value1
    Key2: Value2

Key Information name 2:
    Key1: Value1
    Key2: Value2
```

In this way, you can configure a custom key information, and of course, you can through this method to solve the temporary key information configuration issues.

### Query help information about Serverless Workflow

You can run commands `s config add -h `obtain help information:

## Config get directive

By `s config get `instruction to get the account information that has been configured.

- For example, to obtain all key information: `s config get -l`
![](https://images.serverlessfans.com/s-tool/zh/s-config-get-l.jpg)

   > If the format is cloud vendor (identify), the configuration is global, such as Alibaba in the figure. If the format is project, the current project configuration is used.

- For example, to obtain the key information of a cloud vendor: `s config get -p alibaba`
![](https://images.serverlessfans.com/s-tool/zh/s-config-get-provider.jpg)

   > By default, the system generates information about the cmk and the CMK in the current project.

- To obtain the information about a specified key, use the Baidu demo in the preceding figure as an example: `s config get -p baidu -a demo`

```

Again, for example, delete `alibaba Cloud `the information of the default key for [[[]]] can be either as follows:

```
s config delete -p alibaba -a default
```

> You can only delete the globally configured key information. That is `s config add `you cannot delete a temporary key of the current project.

Here, you can modify the corresponding field information according to the system prompts. If you do not modify the configuration, press enter to skip the configuration.

### Imperative modification

In order to give everyone more convenience, the imperative modification method has also been added here, that is, to specify any other corresponding information while providing Provider (cloud vendor) and Alias (Alias):

The method of using key information is very simple, you only need to fill in the key name in the project, for example, in the project `MyTest1 `used in `test `component. Then, configure the key information `Provider `specify the cloud vendor (Baidu Cloud is specified here), in `Access `by specifying a key alias in the code:

```yaml
MyTest1:
  Component: test
  Provider: baidu
  Access: demo
  Properties:
    Region: Project Information
```

> If you do not use the alias, `Access `can be left blank, or `default`

> If you need to use the key information of the current project, you can use the key name directly.

### Key information usage sequence

If you use a cloud vendor, the project contains the temporary key information and the global key information contains the key with the same alias. The system policies are as follows:
