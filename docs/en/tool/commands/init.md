## Initialize projects in the Application Center

Serverless Devs Tool is a complete application center. You can search for relevant resources and initialize them in the application center. For details, see [search for applications ](search.md)

For example, at this time, we pass `S search `searched for a `FC `related components:

Then we can go directly through `s init fc-event-nodejs10 `initialize a project like this:

## Initialize a Git project

For example, we have a project on Github:

```
https://github.com/anycodes/nodejs10_demo
```

At this point, we can go directly through'

```
s init https://github.com/anycodes/nodejs10_demo
```

Perform initialization, for example:

In the figure, we can see that we have downloaded the project very easily. You have now initialized a project. If the project does not contain Yaml information to describe resources, the resources cannot be deployed smoothly. `Application Center `before deploying the project, you must make sure that the correct resource description is available.

## Help information

Of course, you can also pass `s init `or `s init -h `bring up help document information:
